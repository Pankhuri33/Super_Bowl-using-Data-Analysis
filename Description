Analyzing Super Bowl Viewership and Advertising
In the Analyzing Super Bowl Viewership and Advertising project, you’ll explore the drama behind the Super Bowl—from the games and advertisements to the halftime shows. Using R, you’ll manipulate and visualize data to uncover how these elements interact with one another. Perfect for building your skills in data analysis with tools like ggplot2 and dplyr.

Using the code to display interactive data visualization is easy, but understanding and interpreting the data is hard. Take the Understanding Data Visualization course to explain visualization distribution and learn the best data visualization techniques to communicate complex data.
